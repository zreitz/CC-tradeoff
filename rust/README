This directory contains the Rust source code used for the niche-shadow-based metapopulation simulations (Figures 5, 6D, 6H, S4, S6, S7). Three different sets of ODEs (`MODEL`s) are used: `siderophore`, `lactamase`, and `invertase`. 

See the [Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for instructions to install Rust and Cargo on your system.

Usage: 
```
cargo run --release --bin MODEL -- PARAM_FILE
```

Parameters are set with a JSON file. Test files are provided. For example:
```
cargo run --bin siderophore -- params_siderophore.json
```

The output will be a timestamped CSV file with the following columns:
```
time: round of simulation
alpha: public goods investment of the strain
frequency: fraction of patches occupied by the strain
pressure: total biomass of the strain
```

The `../R/` directory contains the parameters and code used to generate figures from the CSV file.

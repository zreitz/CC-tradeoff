This directory contains the Rust source code used for the kick-flow simulations 
(Figure 7a, Supplemental discussion 5). 

See the [Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) 
for instructions to install Rust and Cargo on your system.

In addition to the `main` binary, there is also the `no-ode.rs`, which uses the analytical equilibrium rather than the numerical ODE solver (generates the black line in Fig. 7A).

Usage: 
```
cargo run --release --bin main -- PARAM_FILE
cargo run --release --bin no-ode -- PARAM_FILE
```

Parameters are set with a JSON file. A test file is provided. For example:
```
cargo run --release --bin main -- params.json
```

The `../R/kick-flow` directory contains the parameters and code used to generate figures.
